### Setup

## Question A

### Part 1

The code for this part of Question A can be found in PCA.py. This code has been fully commented explaining the process of PCA. 

***Note that within the code, to change the value of k, the variable 'k' (found on line 7 of the PCA.py file) must be changed.***

The original scenery image S used can be seen below:

The output reconstructed images for K=10 and K=100 can be see below also:
